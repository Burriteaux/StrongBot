StrongBot Instructions
====================

Starting the Bot:
1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to bot directory:
   cd /Users/matlester/Scrape_Bot

3. Activate virtual environment:
   source env/bin/activate
   (You should see (env) at the start of your terminal prompt)

4. Run the bot:
   python3 discord_bot.py
   (You should see "StrongBot has connected to Discord!")

Testing the Bot:
1. Go to your Discord channel
2. Type: !test
3. Bot should respond with validator and token data

Testing Expense Logging:
1. Type: !test_expense to test Google Sheets and Discord connections
2. Type: !add to create a persistent expense form
3. Select category from dropdown and fill out the expense form
4. After successful submission, a new form automatically appears for the next expense
5. No need to type !add repeatedly - the form stays active!

Stopping the Bot:
1. Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the bot is running

Common Issues:
- If you see "ModuleNotFoundError", make sure you've activated the virtual environment
- If bot isn't responding, make sure it's running and connected to Discord
- If you get "N/A" values, check the API responses in the terminal
